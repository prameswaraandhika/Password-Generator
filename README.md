# Password Generator

This is a simple Java application that generates random passwords of specified lengths. It prompts the user to enter the desired password length and provides the generated password as output. The program allows the user to generate multiple passwords based on their preferences.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine
- A Java IDE or a command-line interface to compile and run the Java code

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE or navigate to the project directory in your command-line interface.

3. Compile the Java code to generate the executable class file.

4. Run the compiled class file to execute the program.

## Usage

1. Run the program, and you will be prompted to enter the length of the password you want to generate.

2. Enter a numeric value representing the desired length and press Enter.

3. The program will generate a random password using a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The generated password will be displayed on the console.

4. After generating a password, you will be asked if you want to generate another password.

5. If you wish to generate another password, enter 'y' and press Enter. If not, enter 'n' and press Enter.

6. The program will continue generating passwords as per your input until you choose to stop.

## Customization

- You can modify the characters used for password generation by updating the `CHARACTERS` constant in the code. Add or remove characters as per your requirements.

- You can customize the program further to include additional features or security measures, such as enforcing specific password criteria or storing generated passwords securely.
